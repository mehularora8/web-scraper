# web-scraper
Python project to learn web scraping. The aim of this web scraper is to find out how many times Jimmy Fallon said a particular word in his tweets from 2013-2017. 

Used http://ethans_fake_twitter_site.surge.sh/ to gather data, because Twitter doesn't like their platform being scraped.
